# Problem Solving Steps

## Understand the problem

1. Restate the problem in your own words.
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem? (Input bounds?) What happens when an input is ommitted.
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

## Concrete Examples

- Start with simple examples
- Progress to more complex examples
- Explore examples with empty inputs
- Explore examples with invalid inputs

## Break It Down

- Write down the steps to the problem (comments or sudo code)
- Examples include, "loop over string..", "If this then that"
- Not to much detail but should be thorough

## Solve/Simplify

Solve the problem, if you can't, solve a simpler problem by ignoring the hard part.

- Find the core difficulty
- Temporarily ignore that difficulty
- Write a simplified solution
- Incorporate that difficulty back in

## Look Back & Refactor

After solve most or all of the problem, look back to learn and see what you could have done better.
Questions you can ask yourself:

- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you understand it at a glance? Readable code.
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem? Modular code.
- Can you improve the performance of your solution? Big O analysis. Time & Space complexity.
- Can you think of other ways to refactor? Style Guide & Company conventions.
- How have other people solved this problem? You could ask this to an interviewer.
